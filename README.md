# Fun-Gmod-Rcon-Tools
A collection of fun clientside rcon tools for Garry's Mod.

To use any of these tools, you need some startup options on Garry's Mod. These are the ones that work: 

-usercon +developer 1 +contimes 0 +ip 0.0.0.0 +sv_rcon_whitelist_address 127.0.0.1 +sv_quota_stringcmdspersecond 1000000 +rcon_password (password) +hostport (port number) +net_start

The source port can be any listen port something else isn't using, but you need to change it to the same port you put in the tool. Same with the rcon password.

I don't provide any support for any tools here, if you are trying to use these I would recommend some basic Python experience.
